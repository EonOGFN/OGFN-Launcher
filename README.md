## OG Fortnite Launcher
This is a simple, free-to-use OG Fortnite Launcher that supports launching every Fortnite version. It works reliably with appropriate checks in place. You can customize everything to suit your project's needs in `Project.cs`.

### Redirect
- You can use an open-source [Redirect/SSL](https://github.com/Milxnor/Cobalt) bypass by Milxnor to redirect to your own Fortnite server.

### Implementation Instructions:
1. Navigate to `\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\NVIDIA\NVaftermath\Win64`.
2. After building Cobalt, rename the generated file to `GFSDK_Aftermath_Lib.x64.dll` and place it in the Win64 folder.
