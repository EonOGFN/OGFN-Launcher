## OG Fortnite Launcher  
This is a simple, free-to-use OG Fortnite Launcher that supports versions above **Chapter 1 Season 3**.<br>
It's highly reliable and up-to-date, with all the necessary checks to help you start your own project. You can customize everything to your project's liking in `Project.cs`.

### Redirect
- You can use an open-source [Redirect/SSL Bypass](https://github.com/Milxnor/Cobalt) by Milxnor to redirect to your own Fortnite server.

### Implementation Instructions:

2. After building Cobalt, rename the generated file to `GFSDK_Aftermath_Lib.x64.dll` and place it in the Win64 folder.
